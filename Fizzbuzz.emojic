💭🔜 Program that take as input (from command line) a positive integer "max" and print the exact result of the FizzBuzz game until the number "max" (excluded) 🔚💭

🏁🍇 
💭Take the list of the items inserted in the command line
🎞🐇💻❗ ➡️ args 
💭 Here we check that a value has actually been inserted looking at the length of the list "args"
